### Hi there I am Shanthinath Mallinathan (Shan)ðŸ‘‹

I am a masters student in robotics gearing up to redefine this industry

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a low computation machine vision approach for mobile manipulator

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Pytorch

ðŸ¤– I have so far worked on manipulator kinematics;
                           path planning, path following and kalman filtering for mobile robots, 
                           people following robot, 
                           OpenCV C++, Python, 
                           Machine learning and machine vision. 
   Some of these works can be found here
